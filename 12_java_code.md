# Jshell
- In terminal,
`c:>jshell`
- It will give you a jshell prompt `jshell>`
- We can execute simple code here. 

Ex:
- jshell> 1+2

- Whenever in Java, if you want to do something, we use methods.
- To print, can use method called `print`. It is a inbuild method in java.
- Whenever you call methods, you have to pass the values.
`jshell>print(5);`
- At the end, put semicolon to mention that something is getting ended.
- This code snippet will produce error.
- So whenever you want to call print method, this print method belongs to something.
- It is available inside Java, so the statement we have to always mention is `System.out.println(6);`
-  `System.out.println("Hello World");`
- Jshell is not for building projects, it is just to experiment the code snippets.

# VS CODE
- In .java file,
`System.out.println("Hello World");`
- In vs code terminal
`javac filename.java`.
- Error
